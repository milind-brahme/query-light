QueryLight is an attempt to create a java based Toad like oracle database client which can handle querying and presenting data.

Querylight is entirely developed in Swing and connectivity is JDBC.

The basic functions like saving the query output to excel or CSV are present, also the exporting rows through insert statment is also provieded in the interface.

Please feel free to add suggestions and enhancements.
